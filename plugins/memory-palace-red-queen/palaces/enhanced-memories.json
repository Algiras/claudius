When you throw a dart, it sticks and rolls clockwise to the NEAREST CLONE. Now here's the MAGIC: if one gnome leaves, his THREE CLONES are spread across the ring, so his keys distribute smoothly to THREE different neighbors instead of ONE! You HEAR the satisfying 'whoosh-whoosh-whoosh' of data spreading evenly, not piling up. The gnomes GLOW BRIGHTER at clone-positions because they're handling LOAD BALANCING. New gnome joins? Insert all 3 clones at once - WHOOOOSH - load rebalances perfectly! The hologram flickers: 'I'm fake but I matter!'",

Statue has CRACKS forming but won't break.\n\nRIGHT (AP): CLONE STORE statues - multiple GLITTERY CLONES operating during a storm. Each clone sells the SAME last milk bottle to different customers - 'WAIT, I sold that?!' When storm clears, clones ARGUE trying to reconcile: 'I PROMISED it to him!' 'No, I did!'
